# SpyGamesCTF
Description: This is a very simple, beginner-friendly Capture the Flag exercise designed to introduce beginners in IT and Cybersecurity to Linux commands and Kali Linux tools.

Situation: You are a cryptographer working for an international spy organization. You are trying to take down the international terrorist organization called PANTHEON. Your current target is a senior leader in the organization codenaned PERSEUS. Your team has successfully hacked into the PANTHEON network, but were only able to retrieve a small amount of files, which your hacking team thought were the most important before they were caught on the network and kicked off. Luckily for you, those files included the personal folder of PERSEUS, believed to contain important information about the group's upcoming operations. Unfortunately the folder is locked. You were also provided with the group's password folder. The passwords are encrypted as well as the code names of all the operatives. Your goal is to crack the encryption to the password folder, figure out which password is used by PERSEUS and open his folder to find the flag. 
Objective:

Find the flag hidden within the stolen data after hacking into the PANTHEON network. 

Tools Required:

Kali Linux

Terminal

Steps:

Boot into Kali Linux:

Boot your computer using a Kali Linux bootable USB or use a Virtual Machine.

Open Terminal:

Once Kali Linux is booted, open the terminal.

Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository containing the CTF scenario code:

git clone https://github.com/ChrisRatliff/SpyGamesCTF

Navigate to the Directory:

Change to the directory containing the Python script:

bash

cd SpyGamesCTF

Search for the Flag:

Use text search or analysis tools to find the flag within the stolen data.

You can use commands like grep or cat in the terminal to search through the output.

Submit the Flag:

Run the Python script to check your input:

python SpyGamesCTF.py

Check the Flag: After submitting the flag, check if it's correct.

If it is, congratulations! You've successfully completed the challenge.
If you are struggling with how to procede, there are two hints. To use a hint, execute the flag to submit the flag, but type "Hint1" or "Hint2" when prompted.
